# RAG-Tutorial Codebase 
This is the repository containing the code base from the tutorial about RAG for STEM scientists.


## Who is this tutorial for?
This tutorial is for STEM scientists that are interested in learning about the general concept of RAG. 
We will apply this concept to the problem of creating a personalized chatbot, which answers questions in the context of your reasearch by using documents from your own (PDF) document library.

## Prerequisits
This tutorial is trageting STEM scientists, so you should have a scientific background and some basic knowledge of Python.
Furthermore it is required to have a Huggingface account, if you don't have one yet, you can create it [here](https://huggingface.co/join).

## What you'll learn

### Basic understanding of retrival augmented generation
First we touch on the general concept of retrival augmented generation (RAG). 
The interaction between the different base-technologies is explained on a conceptual level.

### Technology Stack
In terms of technology, we will use:
- ChromaDB as a database
- Mistral AI as a large language model
- Langchain to manage the flow
- All-mpnet as a wordembedding 

Most of the machine learning related components will be handeled via the Huggingface platfrom.

### Usage example and perfromance assessment 
Finally the RAG portotpye is being tested. The aim is to understand what are the capabilities and the limitations of our system. and how to benchmark systems in the context of our scientific use-case.
